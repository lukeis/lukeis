# Luke Inman-Semerau

## Web Developer

* I've been doing UI focused developement work in web applications since 2003.

* [Top 10 contributor](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/graphs/contributors) to the [Selenium Open Source project](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) (formerly, have not been actively involved since 2017).

* I have strong beliefs in testing to ensure continued quality of a product and that testing is a developement activity.

* Proficient in Java and JavaScript. Python is my scripting language of choice.
